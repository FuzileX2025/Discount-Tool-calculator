            Early payment discounts (also known as cash discounts or prompt payment discounts) are incentives offered by suppliers to encourage buyers to pay their invoices before the standard due date. A typical discount might be expressed as "3/20, net 30," meaning the buyer can deduct 3% from the invoice if paid within 20 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 30 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these discounts may seem small, they can represent significant savings when annualized and compared to other financing options. This tool helps you determine whether taking the discount makes financial sense based on your cost of capital.

            The basic decision rule is to compare the annualized discount rate with your cost of capital (typically your borrowing rate):

            <li>

            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">If Annualized Discount Rate < Borrowing Rate:</span> Do not take the discount, as the cost of obtaining funds exceeds the savings from the discount.

          </ul>

            Additional factors to consider include cash flow constraints, opportunity costs, and the administrative burden of processing payments.
